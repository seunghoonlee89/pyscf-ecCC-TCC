Welcome to PySCF documentation!
===============================

PySCF is a collection of electronic structure programs powered by Python.
The package aims to provide a simple, light-weight, and efficient platform for
quantum chemistry calculations and code development.  The program is developed
with the following principles:

* Easy to install, to use, to extend and to be embedded;

* Minimal requirements on libraries (no Boost or MPI) and computing
  resources (perhaps sacrificing efficiency to reduce I/O);

* 90/10 Python/C (only computational hot spots are written in C);

* 90/10 functional/OOP (unless performance critical, functions are pure).
