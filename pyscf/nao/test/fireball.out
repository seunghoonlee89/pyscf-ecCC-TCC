  This source code is completely dynamical in memory. 
  No diagnostics.input file to read. Will run normally 
   
  ======================================================================
  Now reading file fireball.in 
   
   
  ======================================================================
  The name of the basisfile: 
   file = initial.bas                   
   
  ======================================================================
  The name of the lattice vector file: 
   file = input.lvs                     
   
  ======================================================================
  The name of the k-points file: 
   file = input.kpts                    
   
  ======================================================================
  The initial and final time steps for this 
  simulation (e.g. 101,200). N O T E: setting the initial 
  time step to a value less than or equal to zero causes 
  this program to NOT compute any any derivatives or 
  forces. Thus no simulation, and no calls to forces.
   
  nstepi, nstepf =            1           1
  ======================================================================
   
  Input time step in fs (10**-15 sec): 
  dt =   0.50000000000000000     
   
  The position-velocity filename: XXX.xv. 
  This file is input and output if nstepi .ne. 1.
   file = xv.dat                        
   
  The file name for the acfile: XXX.ac. 
  (acfile records values of acceleration and other 
   time derivatives for last executed step.) 
   file = ac.dat                        
  You can have charge transfer in an SCF theory, or you 
  can run fixed charges as in the Harris functional. The 
  fixed charges are set by the info.dat file. These same 
  charges are the initial guess for the SCF charges. 
   
  Input itheory - 
  This describes the level of theory that you want.
   0 => Harris 
   1 => DOGS 
   2 => extended-Hubbard 
   3 => Kohn-Sham 
  itheory =            1

  Input itheory_xc - 
  This describes the exchange-correlation theory used. 
   0 => Horsfield 
   1 => generalized Sankey-Niklewski 
   2 => McWEDA 
  itheory_xc =            2
   
  Would you prefer to use Lowdin charges or Mulliken 
  charges?  Enter 1 - Lowdin or 2 - Mulliken: 
  3 - Natural population analysis: 
  iqout =            3
   
  The option exists for changing the charge state of the 
  system so that it is non-neutral. Insert qstate, the 
  charge state that you want. 
  qstate =    0.0000000000000000     
   
  This code allows for free dynamics or quenching. 
   
  Insert iquench -
  iquench =  0 ==> Free dynamics (i.e. pure Newton)
  iquench = -1 ==> dynamical quenching 
  iquench = -2 ==> crude constant temperature MD 
                   (from velocity rescaling) 
  iquench = -3 ==> power quench 
  iquench = -4 ==> conjugate gradient minimization 
  iquench = -5 ==> Newton-CG minimization (l-bfgs-b)
  iquench = +n ==> periodic quench every n steps 
   
  In the event that you are searching for an energy 
  minimum, you can also set energy and force tolerances 
  (etol and ftot) which will stop execution after 
  tolerance is achieved. These are read from the 
  the quench.optional file. 
  iquench =           -1
   
 You can do various ensembles such as (0) NVE (also the
 correct setting for doing quenching, conjugate 
 gradient, etc.), (1) NVT with velocity rescaling, (2) NVT
 with a Nose-Hoover chain thermostat and velocity-verlet
 integrator, (3) NVE with velocity-verlet integrator
 Insert 0/1/2/3.
  iensemble=            0
   
  The option exists to calculate a crude energy barrier. 
  The additions described here are designed to "push" the 
  system of interest from a given initial configuration to 
  a given final configuration via a "path of least 
  resistance". 
   
  At each time step we take the vector difference, for 
  each atom, between the current position (at time step #1 
  this is the initial configuration) and the final, or 
  desired, configuration.  These difference vectors are 
  then transformed into unit vectors.  These unit vectors 
  describe the direction that each atom must move in order 
  to reach the final configuration. 
   
  Next the calculated forces for each atom are examined. 
  The question is asked, "Does the force on iatom #i have 
  a nonnegative component in the desired direction?" 
  (Is force dot unit direction .ge. 0?).  If the answer is 
  yes, then we are satisfied that iatom is not being 
  pushed away from its desired final position and we do 
  nothing.  But, if the answer is no, we add enough force 
  IN THE DESIRED DIRECTION to make the component of the 
  force in the desired direction equal to a given value. 
   
  This procedure insures that iatom always has some 
  component of acceleration towards the desired final 
  position of iatom.  Given enough time, iatom will arrive 
  at the desired final position.  (Two rare cases are 
  ignored here, the force on iatom may be exactly zero, 
  and the dot product may be exactly zero, but these two 
  cases could be handled if necessary.) 
  ibarrier =            0
   
  In basvec, we will check the big-4 constraints.
  (1) rcm  = 0
  (2) pcm  = 0
  (3) (1/n) (1/2)*sum (m * v**2) = 3/2 kb * T_initial
  (4) ltot = 0
   
  We allow the option of constraining (1)..(4), or 
  not constraining.
   
  If you want to constrain quantities, insert 1.
  e.g. for no constriants,  insert 0, 0, 0, 0 
  e.g. for all constraints, insert 1, 1, 1, 1 
  Insert iconstraints(1-4): 
     0   1   1   1
  ======================================================================
   
  Do you want to fix the charge? 
  (This is necessary if you are doing a band-structure 
  calculation for example). 
  ifixcharge =            0
   
  Do you want to fix the neighbors? 
  (This is necessary if you are doing a phase transition 
  type calculation for example). 
  ifixneigh =            0
   
  Are you doing a cluster (gas-phase molecule)? 
  In other words, do you want to set the coulomb 
  interaction between cells equal to zero? 
  icluster =            1
   
  Are you using the umbrella sampling algorithm? 
  Insert 0/1 = N/Y 
  iumbrella =            0
   
  The option exists for adding in the long range van der 
  Waals interactions (dispersion terms).  This is done 
  by adding in an empirical terms proportional to 1/R**6, 
  according to a scheme that determines the C_6 parameters 
  by using a combination rule. 
  Are you including the van der Waals interactions? 
  Insert 0/1 = N/Y 
  ivdw =            0
   
  Do you want to use gaussian expansions to evaluate bcna 
  three-center integrals? 
  Note: you must first run gauss_create with the same 
  input files you used when you ran create!!! 
  igauss =            0
   
  Do you want to reimage the atoms to the central cell at
  every N time steps? (zero means never).  This is needed
  if the atoms move a long distance and you get a bad 
  neighbor map as a result.  Note: the coordinates 
  printed out will still not be the minimal image.  This 
  might be incompatible with a barrier or umbrella 
  calculation.  This option is also automatically set 
  to zero if you are doing a cluster calculation. 
  iimage =            0
   
  You have the option of calculating the dynamical
  matrix. You do this by performing ndim X natoms
  calculations. We displace each atom u0 in
  each of the ndim directions. 
  (Normally ndim=3, but may be less for 2d or 
  1d molecules.) Each of these calculations
  is performed in turn by the time step loop. So you
  ultimately need to perform itime=1,ndim*natoms
  time steps.
  Do you wish to perform dynamical matrix calculation?
  idynmat =            0
 Do you want to calculate e-ph coupling?
  (0 .. no; 1 .. yes)
  iephc =            0
   
  Do you want to apply an external field?  If so and
  the field is a harmonic osciallator, put 1. Otherwise
  put zero.
  iharmonic =            0
   
  In a MD simulation you have the option of 
 allowing the system to warm up or cool down during
 the course of the simulation.  The change in 
 temperature will increment linearly over the 
 course of the simulation.  Thus in order to 
 have a smooth change in temperature a small 
 difference between the initial temp and the final 
 temperature should be used over a large number
 of time steps.
  
 Do you want to change the temperature over the
 course of an MD simulation? (0=no,1=yes)
  iendtemp =            0
   
 Do you want to use Nugged Elastic Band method
 to find out minimum energy path? (0=no,1=yes)
  ineb =            0
   
 Do you want to calculate transport?
 (0=no,1=yes)
  itrans =            0
   
 Do you want to run time-dependent SE ?
 (0=no,1=yes)
  itdse =            0
   
 Do you want to apply bias voltage ?
 (0=no,1=yes)
  ibias =            0
   
 Do you want to run nonadiabatic coupling calculation ?
 (0=no,1=yes)
  imdet =            0
   
 The number of iteration steps for the time-dependent 
 integration for each dynamical time-step dt
  nddt =         1000
   
 Do you want recalate kpts, lvs and atom positions?
 (1.0d0=no)
  rescalar =    1.0000000000000000     
   
 Do you want see the energy in the second line of the answer.xyz?
 (0=nothing, 1=energy,temperature 2=energy,temperature,time 3=energy)
  xyz2line =            1
  You have the option of calculating the molecular
  gap correction using Hartree-Fock or Koopman
  aproximations. If igap = 0 no gap corrections
  will be done. If igap = 1, Hartree-Fock correction
  will be used. If igap = 2, Koopman displacement of
  molecular levels will be calculated. If igap = 3
  scissor operator (maybe using Koopman correction) will
  be used.
  igap =            0
   
  The maximum number of iterations to self- 
  consistency.
  max_scf_iterations =          200
